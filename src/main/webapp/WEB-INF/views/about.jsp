		<p>Established in 1876, the Cafe Grabka Coffee Shop has been a staple in the community for over a century. 
		Through community involvement, we give back to the people that have been such a big part of our success. 
		We provide a safe environment for both coffee enthusiasts and casual drinkers to have a space that is their 
		home away from home.</p>   
		<p>We sell whole bean coffee by the pound and have an espresso bar in store. 
		We keep our product dry frozen, which allows our coffee to maintain maximum freshness. 
		This allows our drinkers to enjoy that same great Grabka Coffee flavour at home.</p>
